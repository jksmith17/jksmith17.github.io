<P> Welcome to my home page! I am a third year student at the University of Maine. My major is marketing. I am 20 years old and I have a sister who is two years older than me, Erin, and a sister who is two years younger than me, Caroline. My parents name's are Christopher and Christine. We have a labradoodle, Mia, and a goldendoodle, Jack. I am from Gorham, Maine. In high school, I did cheerleading and volleyball. </P>
<P> I started out college at Coastal Carolina University in Conway, South Carolina. I transferred to the University of Maine after a semester because I decided that school wasn't the right fit for me. I declared my major as Marketing in my second semester.  Along with Marketing, I am also really interested in writing and journalism. </P>
